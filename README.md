# 0-Shell
A minimalist Unix-like shell built in **Rust** â€” no `bash`, no `sh`, just pure system-level control.

---

## About This Project
**0-Shell** is a lightweight, standalone shell inspired by tools like **BusyBox**, built for embedded Linux environments. It uses **Rust** to implement core shell commands **from scratch**, without relying on external programs.

## What You'll Build
A fully working shell that:
- Displays an intelligent prompt: `$ [branch] ~/current/path`
- Features **colored output** similar to `zsh` with syntax highlighting
- Accepts and parses complex user input with **advanced input parsing**
- Executes built-in commands with proper argument handling
- Handles errors gracefully with informative messages
- Supports command chaining and redirection
- Exits on `exit` or `Ctrl+D`

## Shell Features

### **Smart Prompt & UI**
- **Dynamic prompt**: Shows current directory and Git branch when available
- **Colored output**: Syntax highlighting for commands, files, and directories
- **Zsh-like experience**: Modern shell aesthetics with intuitive color coding
- **Error highlighting**: Clear visual feedback for invalid commands


### **System Integration**
- **Git awareness**: Displays current branch in prompt
- **Path intelligence**: Smart directory navigation and display
- **Signal handling**: Proper `Ctrl+D` behavior

## What You'll Learn
- How to use Rust's standard and low-level system libraries
- How to write your own versions of Unix commands
- How to build a modular command-execution loop
- **Advanced terminal manipulation** and ANSI color codes
- **Input parsing algorithms** and command-line argument processing
- **Git integration** and repository status detection
- **Cross-platform terminal handling** in Rust
