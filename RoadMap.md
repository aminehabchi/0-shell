## 0-shell Project: A Structured Learning To-Do List

This to-do list outlines the learning path for building a minimalist Unix-like shell (0-shell) in Rust.

**Phase 1: Foundational Knowledge (Estimated Time: 3 days)**

**Task 1: Understanding Unix System Calls**

* **Explanation:**  Grasp the fundamental Unix system calls crucial for shell functionality (e.g., `fork`, `exec`, `wait`, `open`, `read`, `write`, `close`, `chdir`, `getpid`). Understanding these is the core of building a shell from scratch.
* **Key Concepts:** Process creation, process management, file I/O, file descriptors.
* **Timeframe:** 1 day
* **Resource:**  "Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment" by W. Richard Stevens and Stephen A. Rago (book) - Chapters on process creation and I/O.  Also, explore the `man` pages for each system call.


**Task 2: Rust Fundamentals for System Programming**

* **Explanation:** Solidify your Rust knowledge, focusing on aspects relevant to system programming: memory management (ownership, borrowing), error handling (`Result`), unsafe code (when necessary), and working with C APIs (for system calls).
* **Key Concepts:**  Ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, `Result` type, `unsafe` Rust, FFI (Foreign Function Interface).
* **Timeframe:** 1 day
* **Resource:** The Rust Programming Language book (online) - Chapters on ownership, error handling, and unsafe Rust.  Also, explore Rust's documentation on FFI.


**Task 3:  Basic Command-Line Argument Parsing in Rust**

* **Explanation:** Learn how to parse command-line arguments passed to your shell program. This is essential for interpreting user input and executing commands.
* **Key Concepts:**  `std::env::args()`, argument parsing techniques, handling errors in argument parsing.
* **Timeframe:** 0.5 day
* **Resource:**  Rust by Example (online) - Section on command-line arguments.


**Phase 2: Core Shell Functionality (Estimated Time: 5 days)**

**Task 4: Implementing `cd` Command**

* **Explanation:** Implement the `cd` command to change the current working directory. This involves using the `chdir` system call.
* **Key Concepts:**  `chdir` system call, error handling (e.g., directory not found), path manipulation.
* **Timeframe:** 1 day
* **Resource:**  The `man` page for `chdir`.


**Task 5: Implementing `exit` Command**

* **Explanation:** Implement the `exit` command to terminate the shell. This involves proper process termination.
* **Key Concepts:** Process termination, handling signals.
* **Timeframe:** 0.5 day
* **Resource:**  The `man` page for `exit`.


**Task 6: Implementing `echo` Command**

* **Explanation:** Implement the `echo` command to print text to the console. This involves using `write` system call.
* **Key Concepts:**  `write` system call, handling standard output, string manipulation.
* **Timeframe:** 0.5 day
* **Resource:** The `man` page for `write`.


**Task 7: Implementing Basic Command Execution**

* **Explanation:** Implement the core logic for executing external commands using `fork`, `exec`, and `wait`. This is the most complex part.
* **Key Concepts:** `fork`, `exec` family of functions, `wait`, process management, handling errors (e.g., command not found).
* **Timeframe:** 2 days
* **Resource:**  "Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment" (relevant chapters).


**Task 8:  Input Handling and Loop**

* **Explanation:** Create the main loop of your shell that continuously reads user input, parses it, and executes commands.
* **Key Concepts:**  Standard input (`stdin`), reading from the console, loop structures, command parsing.
* **Timeframe:** 1 day
* **Resource:**  Rust documentation on standard input/output.


**Phase 3: Refinement and Extensions (Estimated Time: 2 days)**

**Task 9:  Error Handling and Robustness**

* **Explanation:** Improve error handling throughout your shell to make it more robust. Handle various error conditions gracefully.
* **Key Concepts:**  Error propagation, informative error messages, handling unexpected input.
* **Timeframe:** 1 day
* **Resource:**  Rust's error handling documentation.


**Task 10:  Bonus Features (Optional)**

* **Explanation:** Implement any of the bonus features (piping, background processes, etc.) to further enhance your shell.
* **Key Concepts:**  Process inter-communication (pipes), signal handling, asynchronous programming (if implementing background processes).
* **Timeframe:** 1 day (or more, depending on chosen features)
* **Resource:**  Relevant sections in "Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment" or online tutorials on process inter-communication and signal handling in Rust.


This structured approach allows for a gradual understanding of the concepts and efficient development of your 0-shell. Remember to test your code thoroughly after each task.  Good luck!
